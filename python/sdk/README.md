# DeepSeek Harness Python SDK

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Python subprocess SDK for driving DeepSeek Harness over newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdio. Install `deepseek-harness-sdk`; it installs the exact same-version `deepseek-harness-runtime-bin` wheel for the current platform.

```sh
python -m pip install deepseek-harness-sdk
```

## Start a runtime

The Python SDK has no separate application entrypoint. It launches the bundled `dsh` CLI with `--profile sdk`; the selected profile owns the JSON-RPC server, agent composition, credentials, persistence, tools, and shutdown behavior.

Every launch requires an explicit Harness home. Pass `dsh_home` or provide a non-empty `DSH_HOME` in the child environment. The SDK deliberately never discovers `~/.dsh`.

```py
from deepseek_harness import DeepSeekHarness, RunResult

with DeepSeekHarness(
    dsh_home="/absolute/path/to/isolated-dsh-home",
    cwd="/absolute/path/to/workspace",
    provider="deepseek-official",
    model="deepseek-v4-flash",
    reasoning_effort="max",
    max_tokens=49_152,
) as harness:
    result = harness.run("Say hi.", session_id="example-001")

print(result.final_response if isinstance(result, RunResult) else result.result.text)
```

`DeepSeekHarness` starts lazily and reuses its runtime until `close()` or context-manager exit. The initial profile handshake has an independent 30-second default bound through `initialize_timeout_seconds`; ordinary activity remains unbounded after its protocol response, whose wait can be limited with `request_timeout_seconds`. A timeout names the selected profile and includes retained runtime diagnostics. `cwd` is the agent workspace; `runtime_cwd` independently selects the subprocess working directory. Both become absolute before launch. `provider`, `model`, optional `reasoning_effort`, and optional positive `max_tokens` are sent during JSON-RPC initialization. `base_url` and `api_key` explicitly override `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the child environment.

## Run text and commands

`session.run(input, on_notification=..., delivery="queue")` is the high-level input entry for strings and content-block arrays. Both use the runtime's [supported command forms and Desktop aliases](../../packages/sdk/server/README.md#command-input); unrecognized input remains an ordinary prompt with its original block order. `delivery="steer"` targets the next available step for ordinary input, including images. Command admission and timing remain owned by the native handler.

The call returns `RunResult` for an ordinary prompt's inbox-receipt-to-idle interval, or `CommandExecution` after a command settles. Use `isinstance(result, RunResult)` before reading `final_response`; otherwise inspect the command's `result.kind`. A command retains its `command_id` and optional `source_event_seq`, rather than selecting an earlier assistant reply.

Content-block arrays use the same command routing as strings. Both `session.run([{"type": "text", "text": "/compact"}])` and `session.run("/compact")` invoke native compaction and return `CommandExecution`. To bypass native command routing, call the low-level `client.session_prompt(session_id, blocks)` and manage the subsequent subscription and wait yourself; runtime skill recognition still applies.

Select a model that supports image input. Submit a command and image in the existing content-block array, for example `session.run([{"type": "text", "text": "/plan Analyze this image."}, {"type": "image", "data": image_base64, "mimeType": "image/png"}])`; `harness.run()` accepts the same input. Plan input and goal creation or editing accept images; `/plan off`, goal controls, compact, and permission commands reject them through the [native attachment rules](../../packages/sdk/server/README.md#command-input). Native command input supports encoded raster images, not general file uploads or client-supplied attachment references.

Each call subscribes before sending and releases its subscription before returning or raising. `on_notification` receives the ordinary activity interval in wire order; command callbacks replay Session-tree notifications from subscription through their own `command/done` after the command response, so that interval can include overlapping work. Calls may overlap without consuming each other's results. Handler refusals return `CommandExecution.result.kind="error"`; routing, protocol, transport and observer failures raise. Malformed native-command responses from `run()` or `session_command()` raise `SdkProtocolError`, with the model validation error retained as the cause. A timeout or observer failure does not roll back runtime work or authorize an automatic retry. `request_timeout_seconds` bounds the protocol response wait, not later ordinary prompt activity.

The default full `sdk` profile provides the supported native commands; `sdk-minimal` keeps unsupported input on its ordinary prompt path. `/compact` can make an auxiliary model request and completes without a normal turn or idle notification; empty history can succeed without a summary. The lower-level `HarnessClient.session_command(session_id, line)` accepts ASCII registered names or canonical English aliases of supported builtin definitions, without prompt fallback or attachments. Use `run()` for Chinese aliases. See the [compaction example](examples/README.md#compact-a-full-sdk-session).

`/permission <preset>` changes only the receiving Session. An unknown preset returns a command error without changing policy. Later input and restoration retain successful changes; other Sessions and the caller's `DeepSeekHarnessConfig` keep their own values. A running approval-policy change can inject a notice and cause another model step. See the [permission example](examples/README.md#change-session-permissions).

`/plan` enters plan mode, `/plan off` leaves, and `/plan <message>` enters then submits the trimmed message through native steer. Its `CommandExecution` confirms command completion, not completion of planning or review. Enter with `/plan` then run ordinary text when a `RunResult` is needed. Plan guidance and `exit_plan_mode` follow their native lifecycle without changing permission settings.

`/goal` shows the current goal; `/goal <objective>`, `edit <objective>`, `pause`, `resume`, and `clear` use the native handler. Creation and resume can start automatic rounds after `run()` returns. Subscribe before sending, observe terminal `goal/change` operations, then call `session/wait` for any closing model reply. Idle between rounds is not goal completion. A restored active goal stays disarmed until explicit resume. See the [goal example](examples/README.md#run-a-goal).

## Customize plugins

Persistent customization belongs to a `dsh` profile. Initialize the shipped SDK profile and install an external bundle with the runtime wheel's `dsh` command:

```sh
export DSH_HOME=/absolute/path/to/isolated-dsh-home
dsh --profile sdk --dump-default-config >/dev/null
dsh plugin --profile sdk add file:/absolute/path/to/my-plugin-bundle
```

The `file:` form installs the local bundle into the profile package tree, where its peer imports reach the bundled installation fallback. The profile manifest records installed dependencies and ordered bundle layers; its `$DSH_HOME/profiles/sdk/cordis.patch.yml` is the persistent user patch. `dsh plugin` needs `pnpm` only when managing external packages. Running the SDK does not require system Node.js.

For an invocation-specific change, pass one or more patch files. They become absolute and are forwarded in order after the profile and home patch layers:

```py
with DeepSeekHarness(
    dsh_home="/absolute/path/to/isolated-dsh-home",
    profile="sdk",
    patches=("/absolute/path/to/first.patch.yml", "/absolute/path/to/last.patch.yml"),
) as harness:
    result = harness.run("Make the requested code change.")
```

`profile` may select another existing profile, but that composition must retain `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sdk-app` or another `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sdk-jsonrpc-server` row. Misconfiguration fails during CLI boot or SDK initialization; there is no complete-config fallback. `dsh_bin` may select another `dsh` executable while preserving the same profile grammar. Arbitrary argv replacement remains an internal fake-runtime test adapter, not public API.

`provider` selects a provider route registered by the chosen Cordis composition; `model` is the model id resolved by that adapter. `reasoning_effort` is an optional non-empty adapter-owned identifier for that exact route; omission preserves the model's own default. `max_tokens` is an optional positive per-request output-token cap for the root agent and its in-process descendants; omission leaves the provider default in control. Initialization rejects a missing adapter, unavailable model, or unsupported effort before a prompt runs. Compaction summaries keep the separate limit configured by their compaction plugin. The bundled default composition registers `deepseek-official`. A custom composition can mount `llm-pi-ai`, configure provider-specific credentials/endpoints there, and select any provider/model present in pi-ai's installed catalog.

The shipped `sdk-minimal` profile is a standalone explicit tree rather than an overlay on `dsh-base`. Select it with `profile="sdk-minimal"`; the ordinary `model` argument is the sole runtime model selection, including for model ids outside the adapter's advisory catalog. It provides a platform-selected persistent shell, `read_image`, `working_directory`, local execution, JSONL sessions, and automatic compaction. Text file tools, settings, managed credentials, telemetry, Web tools, and the full default tool roster remain available through the separate full `sdk` and `web` profiles. The `sdk-minimal` profile leaves unsupported slash input on the ordinary prompt path.

## Results and notifications

For ordinary prompts, `Session.run()` owns an activity interval from its prompt's durable inbox receipt through the next whole-agent idle and returns `RunResult(session_id, final_response, finish_reason, events, notifications)`. `final_response` is the last committed root-session assistant text in the interval. `finish_reason` is the `kind` of the last root-session `turn/end`, such as `completed`, `max-tokens`, or `error`, and is `None` when no turn ended. A `turn/end` without a string `data.reason.kind` violates the protocol and raises `SdkProtocolError`.

`NotificationSubscription.next(timeout_seconds=...)` bounds one local notification wait and raises `TimeoutError` on expiry. Omitting the argument waits indefinitely. A timeout neither cancels runtime work nor closes the subscription; a later call can receive subsequent notifications.

`HarnessClient` retains discovered subagent ancestry for the runtime process lifetime. During `Session.run()`, `RunResult.notifications` and `on_notification` receive the root session and known descendants in wire order. `RunResult.events` contains root-session events only, so descendant output cannot replace the root response. The low-level `session_prompt()` returns the queued message id immediately; callers that bypass `Session.run()` own the later activity boundary.

The selected home stores profiles, plugins, and every profile-owned durable resource. The full `sdk` profile uses its credentials, settings, and session stores; `sdk-minimal` uses JSONL session storage and stores images under `$DSH_HOME/attachments/v1`, with request-image cache under `$DSH_HOME/cache/attachments`. Use a fresh home when those resources must be isolated, and a fresh session id for independent work. Reusing both a harness and session id continues the durable conversation and session-owned resources.

See the [Python tutorial](../../docs/user/guide/python-sdk.md), [runnable example](examples/README.md), and [runtime wheel reference](../sdk-runtime/README.md).

`Session.get_working_directory()` reads the effective working directory; `set_working_directory(path)` changes it and returns the validated absolute path. Both create an unknown Session without running a model turn. Relative paths use that Session's current directory. Origin metadata, permissions, and existing processes remain unchanged. The low-level client provides the same methods with a leading `session_id` argument.
